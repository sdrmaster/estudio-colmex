# Randomized Survey App

I analyze randomized online survey experiments providing messages on Mexico's public safety, corruption, and public health. This interactive app examines how certain institutional designs affect political and quantitative support for tax reforms. The app was built using Python and HTML. I'm busy at the moment but I promise to do an effort to explain every single step involved in the construction of this app as soon as possible. For some of you who are curious enough, this repository is available to explore and gain some insights on the subject.
